#+TITLE: VotingTrees

VotingTrees is a set of routines for implementing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting

At this moment there are MySQL stored procedures and some PHP stuff.

It's *UNCOMPLETE, UNTESTED, UNMANTAINED and EXPERIMENTAL. BUGS* ahead.
Use at your own risk. (or maybe just get inspired by)

** Creating MyISAM tables and stored procedures
   In src folder you can:
   ~cat *.sql | mysql [DB_name] [...]~

** You can try some stuff in PHP
#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php
include("VTvotingTrees.class.php");
$mysqli=mysqli_connect("dbhost","dbuser","password","database");
$votingtrees=new VTvotingTrees($mysqli);

# four users are taking care about "the issue"
$votingtrees->addUserIssueByName(1,"the issue",TRUE);
$votingtrees->addUserIssueByName(2,"the issue",TRUE);
$votingtrees->addUserIssueByName(3,"the issue",TRUE);
$votingtrees->addUserIssueByName(4,"the issue",TRUE);

# some are delegating their "vote" to other users
$issue=$votingtrees->getIssueByName("the issue");
$issue->delegate(1,2);
$issue->delegate(2,3);
$issue->delegate(4,3);

# the "tree" should look like this
# 3_
# | \ 
# 2 4
# |
# 1


# check VTdelegate table or $patharray after calling
$issue->getPathToTop(1,$patharray);
print_r($patharray);
?>
